## Installing R

RStudio is an interactive desktop environment, but it is not R, nor does it include R when you download and install it. Therefore, to use RStudio, we first need to install R.

-   [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
-   [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

1.  You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)[^installing-r-and-rstudio-1]. Search for CRAN on your browser:

[^installing-r-and-rstudio-1]: https://cran.r-project.org/

2.  Once on the CRAN page, select the version for your operating system: Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

Here we show screenshots for Windows, but the process is similar for the other platforms. When they differ, we will also show screenshots for Mac OS X.

3.  Once at the CRAN download page, you will have several choices. You want to install the *base* subdirectory. This installs the basic packages you need to get started. We will later learn how to install other needed packages from within R, rather than from this webpage.

Congratulations! You have installed R.

## Installing RStudio

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management.

1.  You can start by searching for RStudio on your browser:

2.  You should find the RStudio/Posit website as shown [Posit](https://posit.co/downloads/). Once there, click on *Download RStudio*.

4.  Once you select this option, it will take you to a page in which the operating system options are provided. Click the link showing your operating system.

Congratulations! You have installed RStudio. You can now get started as you do on any other program in your computer. On Windows, you can open RStudio from the *Start* menu. If RStudio does not appear, you can search for it. On the Mac, it will be in the Applications folder.
